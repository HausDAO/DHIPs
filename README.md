# DHIPs

Repository of internal DAOhaus Improvment Proposals

## Submitting a DHIP

Submit a new potential DHIP as an [issue](https://github.com/raid-guild/RIPs/issues/new) with the DHIP issue template. Follow the status of the DHIP through the [DHIP Request](https://github.com/raid-guild/RIPs/projects/1). Add a 'Proposal' tag to each DHIP. 

Accepted Finalized DHIPs are added as Pull Requests closing the Issue. A new Discord channel in WarCamp should be created once accepted.
